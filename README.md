# See Colors
 
 A beginner Reactjs project that uses React concepts like State and Components in order to create an app that allows you to enter and see a color, temporarily store that color as a set button you can switch between. 
 
## Motivation
I needed something to build and did not want to copy the Reactjs Tic Tac Toe tutorial. I also really like seeing different colors.
 
 
## Tech/framework used
 
<b>Built with</b>
- [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/)
 
## Features
In order for a button to be created and the color box to show color, the input needs to be an actual color. In order to solve that problem, I used the existing HTML DOM to check if the user input is a color. I set the backgroundColor of the app's root to the input if the input returns null then that color does not exist.
